# Typing Tester

A simple program where the user can select text they want to text themselves with. The user can then type input into the textarea which starts a timer. The target text will then reflect correct/incorrect inputs with a green/red background behind the respective characters. It also includes a stats bar which shows the user's typing; speed, accuracy and their adjusted speed.
